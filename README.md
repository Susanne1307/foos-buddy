## Usage

Install client and server dependencies:

```
npm install
cd client
npm install
```

To start the project properly, you will need a .env file. An .env.example file is already included. The TOKEN-SECRET is needed for the user authentication and can be replaced by anything.

To start the server and client at the same time:

```
npm run dev
```
